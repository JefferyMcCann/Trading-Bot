 Trading-Bot

This is a experimental trading bot that has not yet been added to any api's. 

current issues being addressed. 
1. needs VolitilityL to have its results global to be used against the average
2. figuring out a non crypto public market api and banking api.
3. delete some comments that are just my thoughts on what I *might* do in v5 
4. add a "fake trading" mode that uses real market data to test algorithims. develop my 7 other algorithms and make the current main file become one of many subfiles behind the main program which chooses between fake and real trading and each algorithim. so 14 algo files in total (one real, one fake each).
5. start an experimental file that brings data too a json file (so that it can be started and stopped while still having data to go off of) and if I figure it out integrate it into the main algorithims.
