# Trading-Bot

This is a experimental trading bot that has not yet been added to any api's. 

current issues being addressed. 
1. needs VolitilityL to have its results global to be used against the average
2. VolitilityH needs to be integrated into the code in a similar manner to volitilityL 
3. needs to use volitilityL and volitilityH to create a trading stoploss 
4. figuring out a non crypto public market api and banking api.
5. delete some comments that are just my thoughts on what I *might* do in v5
